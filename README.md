# OneBitBrowser
This is the code for a simple prototype of a one bit browser. It uses a stepper motor to actuate a mechanism that can be in two states (and thus can represent a bit). The project includes code for an Arduino board and the CC3000 WIFI shield by Adafruit, written in C++11 and compiled via CMake using the AVR-GCC Toolchain. It also includes server side node.js code to communicate with the Arduino. 

Perhaps an interseting part of the code is that for allowing the Arduino/CC3000 to access other computers through Bonjour, placed in: /Avr-Arduino Code/mdns. It is however written in C++11 (not compatible with Arduino code at this point). I have also used it as an exercise to test a few C++11 features with the AVR-GCC, so it is not necessarily the clearest or best written.
